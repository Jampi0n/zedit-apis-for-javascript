This javascript library contains function declarations for zedit APIs.
The functions are provides as stub functions with type information and documentation taken from the official documentation (https://z-edit.github.io).

The library is intended to be used together with an IDE like WebStorm (https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).
This library allows the IDE to recognize functions from zedit APIs and give correct code feedback. It can also be used to look up function declarations.
